Addressing the space pirate issue in Sector 7\\n    - Sir Supernova: \\\"We need a better strategy for dealing with these pirates. They've already plundered three cargo ships this month.\\\"\\n    - Captain Stardust: \\\"I'll speak with Admiral Starbeam about increasing patrols in that area.\\n    - Dr. Quasar: \\\"I've been working on a new cloaking technology that could help our ships avoid detection by the pirates.

Let's start gathering the supplies and preparing the games.\\\"\\n    \\n    6. Upcoming team-building retreat\\n    - Ms. Comet: \\\"I would like to propose a team-building retreat to the Moon Resort and Spa.
